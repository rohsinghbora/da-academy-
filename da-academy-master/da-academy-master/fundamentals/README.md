### Practice: ###

#### Before you begin ####
(It is assumed that Git is already installed and working).

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Initialize a simple project in your local repository.
4. Update *.gitignore* file, not to upload */target* folder nor any undesirable and unneeded file.
5. Upload your code with whatever changes you've made. You will upload your individual progress in your master branch. You can also create additional branches for testing/other purposes. Corrections will be only made against your master branch.
6. Every practice functionality must be validated through unit tests. Use the [pytest package](https://pytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html) to make these tests.

#### Exercices ####

1. **Linux basics**: Answer the following questions:

- What command would you use to count the amount of occurrences of the word ​Unix ​in a file? How would make the command case insensitive?
- What command would you use to constantly see the last 100 lines appended to a file that contain the word ​*"ERROR"*​?

2. **Python Basics**: Matrix Calculation

Create a class which allows to represent a matrix of any order or shape (n x n, n x m). It should also allow the following operations with matrices:

- Matrices addition
- Scalar multiplication
- Matrices multiplication
- Matrix transpose
- Matrix determinant
- Adjugate matrix
- Inverted matrix

Add additional methods:

- A method to obtain a matrix row. Do not return repeated rows. E.g., you can specify that the rows 1,3,8 are desired from a 20x10 matrix.

- A method to obtain a matrix column. Do not return repeated columns. E.g., you can specify that the columns 2,4,10 are desired from a 20x10 matrix.

- A method to obtain part of the matrix from a certain column. E.g., from a 10x10 matrix, the 10x2 matrix from column 5 is desired.

- A method to show the matrix on screen as a matrix.

A 3x6 matrix can be defined at the class instantiation time like this:
Matrix([[1,2,3,4,5,6],
	[10,11,12,13,14,15],
	[-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6]])

Do not use the numpy package for this implementation. Just use the Standard Library.
