### Motivation ###
#### Streaming ####
Today data is streaming all around us, with new data sources coming online.
It is also called by names such as stream processing, real-time analytics, streaming analytics, complex event processing, real-time streaming analytics, and event processing. Although some terms historically had differences, now, tools have converged under term stream processing.

Big data established the value of insights derived from processing data. The value of such insights is not created equal. Some insights have much higher values shortly after something has happened and that value diminishes very fast with time. Stream processing targets such scenarios. The key strength of stream processing is that it can provide insights faster, often within milliseconds to seconds.

With the rise of IoT and Smart Devices, we are generating data at an unprecedented speed. With distributed computing, data is generated somewhere and processed somewhere else. Sensors or UI on devices capture some data (manual or automated) as an event and send it to some other unit for processing. This happens continuously.

#### Dataflow ####
[Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/) is a fully-managed service for transforming and enriching data in [stream](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/big-data/stream-analytics/) (real time) and batch (historical) pipelines written using the [Apache Beam SDK](https://beam.apache.org/).

* Setup a Single Node Kafka Cluster  (read Apache Kafka documentation)


#### Exercices ####
Consider a hypothetical fleet management company that needs a dashboard to get the insight of its day to day activities related to vehicles. Each vehicle in this fleet management company is fitted with a GPS based geolocation emitter, which emits location data containing the following information
1.  **Vehicle Id**: A unique id is given to each vehicle on registration with the company.   
2.  **Latitude and Longitude**: geolocation information of vehicle.
3.  **Availability**: The value of this field signifies whether the vehicle is available to take a booking or not.  Current Status (Online/Offline) denotes whether the vehicle is on duty or not.
    
### Functional Requirements
1.  The users should be able to know the total number of vehicles online and offline at any point of time. Feel free to use the technology you want to see the information
